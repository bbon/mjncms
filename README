MjNCMS - Mojolicious-[PERL]-based CMS [Mj Not CMS :) ]

Project goal is not create CMS, but create ``CMS`` enviropment.
Let me describe: every time you start new project you need 
mess with "boring" stuff. Like user model, categories, 
static pages, make admin panel, other simple and not stuff.
This always takes time - you have idea, but days/weeks later 
you (pssoble :)) still mess with them and `core functional` is stil "far far away".
I meet same problem - my "framework/kitchen" 
(CGI.pm/Template-Toolkit) was not modern at all.
I've desided build new useful env based on some mainstream framework.
And Mojo/Mojolicious becomes my desigeon.

So this is first public "*yehay it's working*" realise :).
