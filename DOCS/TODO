#Things in mind:

  Code cleanup/optimizing (i was too paranoid ad checks maybe)/Mojolicious::Guides::CodingGuidelines 
  Make everythin as plugins, aso separate parts (at least routes) - adm/content side? [maaaaybe]
  Split MjNCMS::Content to sub modules [Cats, Pages, Urls, Filemanager] - it's too big
  global %MULTISESSION{'SITE'}{'SOMEKEYS'} feature - static ocnnections to DB/MEMD/etc
  breadcrumbs
  Improve texts/localization (ready loc/po files, error messages, etc)
  Access permissions for Menus (like @ pages, ' "visible for" option ')
  Access/Post permissions for Categoryes (-//-)
  System variables @ DB feature (excep database itself :) - init, load params from db, update keys, continue)
  Comments system, 
  Comments as forum thread option 
  Tag clouds system
  "Contact us" customizeble form
  E-mail messaging core (plain text, html, attaches @emain  max easily as possible) + Subscribe system
  RSS core (global) + extensions (content complete/per category)
  Gallery/Image simple api (resize, add watermark)??? - for pages at least - 
	parse page on save and make correctly sized copies of images at page, 
	(if they were resized in cfeditor (big img but wth h/s = 10px or smth)), other reasons
  FAQ subsystem
  Documentation/Help
  Make a bit "useful"er "demo" site.
  WebSocket simple app. Like chat (with google chrome possible, it supports WebSocket out-of-box alredy).
  Improve templates, maybe self-made "admin theme"
  Improve AJAX usage @ admin pages
  Extend possible databases to use: from mysql to postgress or maybe more over orm [for base admin]. At least test/fix postgress :)
  Extend/test multi site feature.

..not complete...
